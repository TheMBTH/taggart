Taggart is a generation library for tag-based markup (HTML, XML, SGML,
etc.). It is useful for times when you just want code and functions, not
templates. We already have great composition and abstraction tools in
Elixir. Why not use them? With this approach, template composition through
smaller component functions should be easy.

[Documentation](http://hexdocs.pm/taggart/)

There is a [blog post](https://medium.com/@ijcd/announcing-taggart-4e62b485e882)
with and introduction and more documentation.

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `taggart` to your list of
dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:taggart, "~> 0.1.2"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

Taggart produce Phoenix-compatible "safe" html through underlying usage of the
[`Phoenix.HTML.content_tag/2`](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_html/Phoenix.HTML.Tag.html#content_tag/2).
Since it just produces IO Lists, it should remain compatible with any
other library that uses the same format.

### Syntaxes

Taggart supports a number of different syntaxes:

```
use Taggart

div("Name")

div("Name", class: "bold")

div(class: "bold", do: "Name")

div do
end

div(class: "bold", do: "Name")

div(class: "bold") do
  "Name"
end

a(href: "#bottom", class: "uk-button uk-button-default", "i-am-a-boolean": true), do: "Click me!"
```

### Nesting

You can nest and combine in expected ways:

```
use Taggart

name = "Susan"
age = 27

html do
  body do
    div do
      h2 "Buyer"
      p name, class: "name"
      p age, class: "age"
    end
    div do
      "Welcome"
    end
  end
end
```

### Embedding in Phoenix Forms

You can embed Taggart inside Phoenix helpers using `Taggart.taggart/1`
to create IO List without creating a top-level wrapping tag.

```
use Taggart

form = form_for(conn, "/users", [as: :user], fn f ->
  taggart do
    label do
      "Name:"
    end
    label do
      "Age:"
    end
    submit("Submit")
  end
end)
```

### Using Phoenix Helpers

```
use Taggart

html do
  body do
    div do
      h3 "Person"
      p name, class: "name"
      p 2 * 19, class: "age"
      form_for(build_conn(), "/users", [as: :user], fn f ->
        taggart do
          label do
            "Name:"
            text_input(f, :name)
          end
          label do
            "Age:"
            select(f, :age, 18..100)
          end
          submit("Submit")
        end
      end)
    end
  end
end
```

### Using from Phoenix Views

Phoenix views are just functions, so itâ€™s possible to use pattern
matching directly in a view to render your pages.

```
defmodule TaggartDemo.PageView do
  use TaggartDemoWeb, :view
  use Taggart

  def render("index.html", assigns) do
    taggart do
      render_header("My Fancy Title")
      render_body
      render_footer
    end
  end

  def render_header(title) do
    header do
      h1 title
    end
  end

  def render_body do
    main do
      ul do
        for i <- 1..3, do: list_item(x)
      end
    end
  end

  def render_footer do
    footer do
      "So Long Folks!!!"
    end
  end

  def list_item(x) do
    "Name: "
    li(x)
  end
end
```

## Converting from HTML

### PrestoChange.io

You can use the online tool at [prestochange.io](http://www.prestochange.io).

### Install taggart escript using homebrew

```
brew install ijcd/tap/taggart
```

```
Reads HTML from stdin and writes Taggart to stdout.

Usage:
  taggart --indent <n|tabs>
  taggart --help

Options:
  -h --help  Show this message.
  --indent   Either n (number of spaces to indent) or "tabs"
```

### Build taggart escript from source

```
mix escript.build
./taggart
```

## Design

The design had two basic requirements:

1. Simple Elixir-based generation of tag-based markup.
2. Interoperate properly with Phoenix helpers.

I looked at and tried a few similar libraries (Eml, Marker), but
either wasn't able to get them to work with Phoenix helpers or had
problems with their approach (usage of @tag syntax in templates where
it didn't refer to a module attribute). My goal was to keep things
simple.
